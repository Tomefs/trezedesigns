          <h2>AJT SC Povoense Matchdays and Social Media Posts</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            The "Aprende e Joga com Talento" soccer school at Sporting Clube
            Povoense, is a project founded on October 5, 2010, located in the
            municipality of Cantanhede, my hometown, in the town of Póvoa da
            Lomba. The work done for the club was carried out during the period
            I was involved with the club as a player and coach.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I was a soccer player for SC Povoense, a club that was part of my
            training and that of my younger brothers, not only as players, but
            also as people. I started experimenting with video editing and had
            the opportunity to produce design work where I could try new things.
            I also had the opportunity to gain some experience as a coach of
            teams at various training levels. These designs were created with
            the aim of improving the club's social communication by helping to
            promote the sports weekends of the different youth soccer teams that
            make up the club. In between, I also made some posts and edited
            promotional videos for recruitment training sessions.
