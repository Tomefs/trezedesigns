                  Hello there! I’m Tomé Simões. I’m a graphic designer from Portugal, with a degree in Design & Multimedia at the University of Coimbra. 
                  I studied Visual Arts in high school, at the time I had no idea what design was, I just enjoyed drawing and I was good at it. 
                  I started creating and editing videos for fun. 
                  Later I had my first job for a futsal club where I was asked to create some designs for posters and videos.

                    <p>
                       Right now I’m starting my own path in the world of design and multimedia. My main focus is based on 
                       creating visual identities and graphic designs for print and social media such as posters, 
                       flyers, business cards, animations, social media posts, web design, illustrations and more.

                    Here you'll find some of my work that have been done along my path discovering the world of design and multimedia. Some of them 
                    even before I started studying and understanding what design was and its different subjects. You'll find works 
                    each unique in its own way. Work done specifically for posts on the social networks facebook and instagram, digital illustration projects, 
                    work for the web, logos, a project for an installation, and the creation and design of a board game. Hope you enjoy!
