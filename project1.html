          <h2>Kaija's Flowers</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Project created as part of the Generative Design course in the
            Design and Multimedia Master's Degree program at the University of
            Coimbra
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This sketch in Processing creates a dynamic audiovisual composition
            that combines real-time video , ASCII art, and graphic animations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The basis of the project are videos of plants, chosen specifically
            for their dark backgrounds, which are loaded and played in a
            continuous loop, with the aim of highlighting the colors of the
            natural elements, filters, and lighting effects. The application
            continuously generates small animated rectangles, whose position,
            size, and effects are random within a given range, but conditioned
            by the color of the video image, each displaying an excerpt from the
            original video at that position applying graphic effects such
            as dilation, erosion, color inversion, or posterization.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Inspired by the work and elements that inspired composer Kaija
            Saariaho, where natural elements, color, light, visual arts and
            technology merge into a single collection of unique and constantly
            changing artistic objects that give image to the artist's sound
            compositions.
