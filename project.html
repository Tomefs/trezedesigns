          <h2>SC FERREIRA DO ZÊZERE</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Sport Club Ferreira do Zêzere is a sports club founded on August 15,
            1935, located in the village of Ferreira do Zêzere. It is a football
            club, but it stands out in the sport of futsal, where it currently
            competes in the main futsal league in Portugal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 2021, I was contacted by SCFZ to do some work related to futsal
            and soccer. It was pre-season, and my job was to create designs for
            posters, flyers, and brochures for training sessions to recruit
            young players.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I also ended up doing some work in the field of video editing and
            animation creating motion graphics to promote recruitment training.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The most notable part of this project was the presentation of the
            children and young people who had joined the club at that time. I
            was asked to create a template for an animation presenting each
            athlete linked to the club in the youth ranks. So I had to find a
            way to create something interesting and appealing and ended up
            creating an animation in fake 3D of a letter design for each
            athlete.
