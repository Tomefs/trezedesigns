          <h2>"Scribble Learning" an educational app</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Project created as part of the Interactive Media Design course in
            the Design and Multimedia Degree Program at the University of
            Coimbra.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our proposal consisted of designing an application that supports
            children with special educational needs in their learning,
            communication, and integration. Our application has the flexibility
            to be used in a classroom setting, through individual and group
            educational games, which aim to encourage communication and
            relationships among all children participating in the activity. It
            can also be used at home, under the supervision of parents or any
            other legal guardian, so that they can continuously monitor their
            learning.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our goal was to create an application with exercises and activities
            for the educational needs of pre-primary and primary school children
            in a learning context.
